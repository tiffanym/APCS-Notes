	//lets look at how we can sort things with the built in sort:
	String[] words = { "fish","garbage","onions","feet","sewage","apes"};

	//To use the built in sort we need to import java.util.Arrays

	//This gives us many useful array related methods:
	//toString
	//sort
	//equals
	//and more! 
	//These are things you must be able to write at this point.

	//Sorting requires that you call sort on an array:
	//Arrays.sort( <Array of Comparables> );
	//remember you can only sort comparable things

	System.out.println( Arrays.toString(words) );//print it!
	Arrays.sort(words); //and sort it.
	System.out.println( Arrays.toString(words) );//print it again!
